<p>I enjoy many kinds of programming and development, with an interest in mobile app development. I'll be moving out to San Francisco this summer to begin working full time as an Android Developer for <a href="https://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>. Below is some of my past and current work.</p>

<h3>
<a name="SpursGifs_xposterbot" class="anchor" href="#xposter"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SpursGifs X-Poster Bot</h3>

<p>A reddit bot I made to x-post any gif, vine, and gfycat links from /r/coys over to /r/SpursGifs. Done in Python and using Praw (a python wrapper for Reddit's API). Did it mainly for fun while sitting bored in a hotel room. Runs every hour via scheduler on Heroku.</p>

<h3>
<a name="HoloGoogl" class="anchor" href="#HoloGoogl"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Holo Goo.gl</h3>

<p>This was my first major venture into Android app development. I figured it'd be a good start, due to its simplicity, while being good practice for a multitude of concepts. It's admittedly an unorganized jumble of code at the moment, as it was more of an organically grown project, but I plan on doing a major rewrite of it over the winter break and releasing it on the play store.</p>

<h3>
<a name="WCDB" class="anchor" href="#WCDB"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>World Crises DB</h3>

<p>This was our major project for the Fall 2013 Software Engineering course, under Dr. Glenn Downing. The repository itself is private and closed-source, but essentially it was a project in full stack. We had a group of 6, and built a full database-backed website powered by Django and hosted on Heroku. I worked mainly on the API layer and tests for it, as well as the unique API call we made in the form of a game.</p>

<p>To access the API, you can use a number of different requests. Below are a few basic call types:</p>

<pre><code># Get list of crises
GET
http://goldenretrievers.herokuapp.com/api/crises

# Get info for a particular crisis
GET
http://goldenretrievers.herokuapp.com/api/crises/{id}

# Works for "organizations" and "people" as well
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="FlashNotifier" class="anchor" href="#flashnotifier"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FlashNotifier</h3>

<p>This is the Android app I worked on in a group project for my Fall 2013 Mobile Computing course, under Professor Mike Scott. The basic premise of the app is to offer support for using the camera LED light as a 3rd option for broadcasting notifications (on top of vibration and ringtones). I also implemented an internal API that other apps could access to use our service, with built-in access control for the user. I plan on continuing work on it after the class and hopefully finalizing it for release on the play store over the winter holiday. A sample of our API is included below (one of these days I'll fix it and add syntax highlighting):</p>

<pre><code class="java"># Make an API request like this:
Intent i = new Intent("com.leepapesweers.flashnotifier.API");

// Put flash pattern in request
// OPTIONAL
ArrayList<Integer> pattern = new ArrayList<Integer>();
pattern.add(50);
pattern.add(50);
i.putIntegerArrayListExtra("flash_pattern", pattern);

// Put sending application package name
// REQUIRED
i.putExtra("calling_application", getPackageName());

// Send the broadcast
sendBroadcast(i);
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="SureWalk" class="anchor" href="#surewalk"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SUREwalk</h3>

<p>This is an app that I am currently developing with several other classmates on behalf of the SUREwalk student org. on campus. SUREwalk is a service offered by student government, where a student can call at late hours of the night and they will send two escorts to walk with them to wherever they are going. There are 3 components to the app: webapp, iOS app, and Android app, with our backend powered by Parse. I am working on the Android app portion of it with Guy Hawkins (<a href="https://github.com/GHawk1ns" class="user-mention">@GHawk1ns</a>), Chris Roberts (<a href="https://github.com/nasageek" class="user-mention">@nasageek</a>), and Sam Thompson (<a href="https://github.com/st028" class="user-mention">@st028</a>).

Due to some of the private nature of the backened functionality, the app is closed source. The planned release date however is January 2014. </p>
