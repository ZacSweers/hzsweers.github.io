<p>I enjoy many kinds of programming and development, with an interest in mobile app development. I'll be moving out to San Francisco this summer to begin working full time as an Android Developer for <a href="https://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a>. Below is some of my past and current work.</p>

<h3>
<a name="UTCS Android app" class="anchor" href="#utcsapp"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>UTCS Android app</h3>

<p>An app + backend cgi service that I developed for a CS 370 credit for the department. The backend service was developed partially in collaboration with another student, whom worked on the iOS analogue. The app provides useful utilities and information for students, and the goal was to hopefully bridge the gap between the department and student body while paving the way for future large scale collaborations for course credit. The app and backend are closed source, but a Play Store link is provided below.</p>

<h3>
<a name="FB_Mod_Bot" class="anchor" href="#fbmodbot"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Facebook Mod Bot</h3>

<p>A Facebook bot I wrote to moderate a group that I admin. Written in Python using facebook-sdk (a Python wrapper for Facebook's Graph API). Has since been cut down a bit due to Facebook repeatedly taking down the placeholder account we'd create for it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="SpursGifs_xposterbot" class="anchor" href="#xposter"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SpursGifs X-Poster Bot</h3>

<p>A reddit bot I made to x-post any gif, vine, and gfycat links from /r/coys over to /r/SpursGifs. Done in Python and using Praw (a python wrapper for Reddit's API). Did it mainly for fun while sitting bored in a hotel room. Runs every 10 minutes via scheduler on Heroku.</p>

<h3>
<a name="FBGroupAnalytics" class="anchor" href="#FBGroupAnalytics"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Facebook Group Analytics</h3>

<p>This originally started as a script (see the "Tidbits" section below), but has now turned into a full repo doing miscellaneous analytics on a given Facebook group.</p>

<h3>
<a name="HoloGoogl" class="anchor" href="#HoloGoogl"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Holo Goo.gl</h3>

<p>This was my first major venture into Android app development. I figured it'd be a good start, due to its simplicity, while being good practice for a multitude of concepts. It's admittedly an unorganized jumble of code at the moment, as it was more of an organically grown project. No longer developing it due to time constraints and the release of a much nicer Goo.gl app in the Play Store :P</p>

<h3>
<a name="WCDB" class="anchor" href="#WCDB"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>World Crises DB</h3>

<p>This was our major project for the Fall 2013 Software Engineering course, under Dr. Glenn Downing. The repository itself is private and closed-source, but essentially it was a project in full stack. We had a group of 6, and built a full database-backed website powered by Django and hosted on Heroku. I worked mainly on the API layer and tests for it, as well as the unique API call we made in the form of a game.</p>

<p>To access the API, you can use a number of different requests. Below are a few basic call types:</p>

<pre><code># Get list of crises
GET
http://goldenretrievers.herokuapp.com/api/crises

# Get info for a particular crisis
GET
http://goldenretrievers.herokuapp.com/api/crises/{id}

# Works for "organizations" and "people" as well
</code></pre>

<h3>
<a name="FlashNotifier" class="anchor" href="#flashnotifier"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FlashNotifier</h3>

<p>This is the Android app I worked on in a group project for my Fall 2013 Mobile Computing course, under Professor Mike Scott. The basic premise of the app is to offer support for using the camera LED light as a 3rd option for broadcasting notifications (on top of vibration and ringtones). I also implemented an internal API that other apps could access to use our service, with built-in access control for the user. A sample of our API is included below

Update: Due to time constraints and the ready availability of other other apps in the store that offer the same functionality, I am no longer working on this.</p>

<h3>
<a name="SUREwalk" class="anchor" href="#surewalk"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SUREwalk</h3>

<p>This is an app that I am currently developing with several other classmates on behalf of the SUREwalk student org. on campus. SUREwalk is a service offered by student government, where a student can call at late hours of the night and they will send two escorts to walk with them to wherever they are going. There are 3 components to the app: webapp, iOS app, and Android app, with our backend powered by Parse. I collaborated on the Android app portion of it with Guy Hawkins (<a href="https://github.com/GHawk1ns" class="user-mention">@GHawk1ns</a>), Chris Roberts (<a href="https://github.com/nasageek" class="user-mention">@nasageek</a>), and Sam Thompson (<a href="https://github.com/st028" class="user-mention">@st028</a>).

Unfortunately this project never launched, but it was a ton of fun and we all learned a lot!

<h3>
<a name="Tidbits" class="anchor" href="#tidbits"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tidbits</h3>

<p>Here are some miscellaneous bits of code that I'll post in the form of gists.</p>

<ul>
<li>(Python) <a href="https://gist.github.com/pandanomic/8577232">Facebook likes counter</a>. This little script gets the top users in a group ranked by likes. Uses a python wrapper for Facebook's Graph API. Since been migrated to an analytics repo.</li>
<li>(How-to) <a href="https://gist.github.com/pandanomic/8595628">Reddit Bot Heroku on Crash Course</a>. This is a write-up I did for a fellow reddit bot maker on how to get a locally running reddit bot script running automatically on Heroku using only free add-ons.</li>
